# PropertyMatters
Property title secured by Blockchain

## Inspiration
Property title document forgery, resulting in the owner going through a lot of stress.

Transferring property in the Czech Republic and many other countries takes a long time.

Property fraud costs a lot & property transfer times are long.

People want their property secured & they want to transfer quickly.

## What it does
Our solution uses smart contracts on a blockchain. Goal is to reduce fraud, reduce transfer times & reduce work for the Cadastral Office. 

## How we built it
We built a smart contract with Solidity and then worked towards connecting that to a UI, as well as working on a sustainable business model. 

## Challenges we ran into
Connecting JS UI with Ethereum test network. Model still requires trusthed authority for approving property transfer.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning how to code a smart contract including learning online and from mentors. 

## What we learned
SmartContracts, Solidity, Remix, Truffle Suite, Ganache,...

## What's next for PropertyMatters
Presenting and working on finer details and improving UI as well as interviewing relevant parties - including the related authorities - to seek feedback and provide trust in our platform.
